#Introduction

This program was written by Nicolas Null and Jalen Wayt. The conceptual idea is credited to Nicolas Null.
<br />
It was designed to automate the process of creating PowerPoint presentations for CSU.

#Instructions
<br />
##Installing Python and required Libraries

If you do not already have Python installed, you can install it at [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
<br />
Currently, the only library used is known as python-pptx. In order to install the library, a batch file is included for your convenience. If you would prefer to use the command line, you can type "pip install python-pptx".
<br />

##Updating Organization Information
The program pulls information from the *groupInfo.txt* file. If any changes are made to the leadership of CSU, please make those changes there.
<br />

##Changing Format of PowerPoints
The program uses the format.pptx file to determine the theme to use. If you open the file, you can select a different theme and/or design. This will be incorporated into the generated presentation.

##Additional Information
The first version of this program only contains the verses for the King James Version (KJV). We do intend on adding some other languages upon request from potential users of this program.
<br />
In order to run the program, you can execute the 'runme.bat' file.
